# Bot-O-Joe

The Bot-O-Joe is a simple interactive discord bot that reads member message and generates responses to the same channel whenever a trigger word is found. 
It also allows the user to add models and responses.

##FAQ

What is a trigger word? 
- A model is assigned a trigger word/model key. A trigger word is a word that when read in a member message, 
generates a response from a pool of responses assigned to that model. 


# Future Updates 

1.) Time-delay from member message to model response (adds a realistic layer to the bot)
2.) Change the nickname of the bot to the model key
3.) Refactor to improve performance
